## How to translate:

1. Go to the Bitbanana's [Weblate project][weblateproject]
2. If you do not have a weblate account, create one. Without a weblate account you can only see but not edit the translations.
3. Choose your language or create a new one if it does not exist yet.
4. Start translating.
5. Celebrate yourself for supporting a free open source project! This step is MANDATORY!


## When will my translation be visible in the app?

To keep the repository clean we will do one translation update right before each release. This means your translation will only be available in the next release. There is no fixed schedule when releases are happening.
So this might take a few days or a few weeks.
If the language is translated to 100%, we will add it to the language selection list. If not, it is only accessible if you choose "System Language" and your smartphone is set to the corresponding language.
If a language later drops below 50% it will be removed from the language selection list again.
